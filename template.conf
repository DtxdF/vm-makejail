# We need this so as not to confuse tmux, at least for desktop users.
# The problem is very rare, but it can be reproduced when using tmux
# on the host and you start/restart the jail (within the tmux session),
# so the vm-bhyve rc(8) script will try to start the virtual machine
# with the user's environment, confusing tmux, resulting in the error
# "error creating /tmp/tmux-<host user UID>/default (No such file or directory)"
# (which is not easily visible) and, worse, the virtual machine will
# not start unless it is started manually.
#
# Another alternative is the following patch:
